# Test Time Adaptation (TTA) project 

Test Time Adaptation (TTA) explores the possibility to improve a model's performaces working at test time instead of fine tuning it in a "traditional" way. That can be a really effective and helpfull practice mostly for 2 reasons:

1) ðŸ’¥ Fine tuning itself might be not so straight forward.
It really depends on the architecture, but it can be challenging.

2) ðŸ’¸ Big models require non neglectable computational capacity & data to work with.
(Lots of money).

Our obective is to implement a possible TTA application improving the performances of an image classifier.
